>
> THIS VERSION WILL REPLACE THE OTHER ONE

---

Rewrite plans (partially based on WSSEF feedback <3):
- [ ] Support Debian-based distros instead
    - more stable, more software support
    - resources for beginners
    - large amount of distros under one pkgmngr means customization
- [ ] Shift away from customizing personalizations a lot (will have to support multiple DEs/WMs)
    - only light/dark mode?
    - wallpaper
    - taskbar?
- [ ] Rewrite in a more organized format
    - less boilerplate
    - `Software` objects should be more alike, so they can be run piece-by-piece
- [ ] GUI (because apparently users can't type)
    - select software to install
    - add in undetected software
    - automate USB creation
