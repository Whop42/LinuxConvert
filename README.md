## Rewrite plans (based on WSSEF feedback <3):

- [ ] Rewrite in a more organized format
    - redo file structure
    - storage system (module)
    - structured windows/linux
    - `Software` objects should be more alike, so they can be run piece-by-piece

- [ ] Support Debian-based distros instead
    - more stable, more software support
    - resources for beginners
    - large amount of distros under one pkgmngr means customization

- [ ] Shift away from customizing personalizations a lot (will have to support multiple DEs/WMs)
    - only light/dark mode?
    - wallpaper
    - taskbar?

- [ ] GUI (because apparently users can't type smh)
    - select software to install
    - add in undetected software
    - automate USB creation?
